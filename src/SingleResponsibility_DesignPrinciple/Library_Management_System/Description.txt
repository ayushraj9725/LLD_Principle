Problem:
In a library system, when a book is checked out or returned:

-> Inventory Management: The system needs to update the availability of the book.

-> Notification: The user should be notified about the status of the book (checked out or returned).

-> Fines Calculation: If the book is returned late, a fine needs to be calculated.

Applying SRP:
   BookInventory class handles the inventory management.
   NotificationService class is responsible for sending notifications.
   FineCalculator class calculates the fine (if any).
