Problem:
      In an e-commerce application, when a customer places an order, several tasks need to be performed:

-> Order Processing: Checking product availability, calculating the total price, updating inventory.
-> Payment Handling: Processing the payment through a payment gateway.
-> Notification: Sending email/SMS notifications to the user regarding order status.


Applying SRP:
   Each class should have only one responsibility. For example:
   OrderProcessor : class handles the logic for order processing (checking availability, updating inventory).

   PaymentProcessor : class is responsible for handling payment (communicating with the payment gateway).

   NotificationService : class is responsible for sending notifications (email/SMS).

   This way, each class handles only one aspect of the system and can be tested and maintained independently.
