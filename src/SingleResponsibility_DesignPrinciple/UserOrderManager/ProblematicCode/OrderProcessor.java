/*
     what is the problem of this class of OrderProcessor

   -> Why this violates SRP:
        1. Order Processing: This involves handling the order itselfâ€”likely updating status, saving to a database,
        or invoking other business logic.

        2. Total Sum Calculation: This is a calculation task that might require logic specifically for calculating
        totals for the order.

        3. Email Notification: Sending notifications is a separate concern, likely involving external services or
        communication logic.

    -> How to Refactor:
        To adhere to SRP, we should separate the responsibilities into distinct classes, each focusing on a single task
