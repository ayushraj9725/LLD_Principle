Problem:
In a hotel system, when a customer books a room:

 -> Room Availability: Check if the room is available.
 -> Billing: Calculate the cost for the stay.
 -> Check-in: Handle customer check-in process.
 -> Notification: Send a booking confirmation to the customer.

Applying SRP:
 -> RoomAvailabilityService class is responsible for room availability checking.
 -> BillingService class handles billing and cost calculation.
 -> CheckInService class handles check-in process.
 -> NotificationService is responsible for sending booking confirmation.
