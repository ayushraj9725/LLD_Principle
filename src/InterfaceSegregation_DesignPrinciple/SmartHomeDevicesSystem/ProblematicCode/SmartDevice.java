// PROBLEM STATEMENT :
// ðŸ›  Problem Statement:
// Imagine a smart home automation system where all devices (Lights, Fans, Thermostat, Door Lock) implement a single interface SmartDevice.

// WHAT DOES STATS ISP : A client should not be forced to depend on the interfaces it does not use
// what does it mean : Instead of using a single large interface with multiple responsibilities using by breaking it into smaller sub interfaces
// so that the required responsibility will be handled by the needed classes ( it can implement what they want by inheriting )

// the problems it here this SmartDevice is an interface which is large it has many responsibilities below

  /*   ðŸš¨ Issue (Violation of ISP):

        Light doesnâ€™t need setTemperature(), setSpeed(), or lock().
        Fan doesnâ€™t need lock() or setTemperature().
        Door Lock doesnâ€™t need setTemperature() or setSpeed().

        âœ… Solution (Applying ISP)
        We split the interface into smaller, more relevant interfaces.  see in the better code
