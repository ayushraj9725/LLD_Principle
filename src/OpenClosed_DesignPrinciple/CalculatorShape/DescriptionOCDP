-> What Is Open/Closed Design Principle  ? :
               The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) is one of the key principles of object-oriented design and is part of the SOLID principles
               (a set of five principles that help in designing software that is easy to maintain and extend).

-> Open/Closed Principle Defined:
               The Open/Closed Principle states that a class, module, or function should be open for extension,
               but closed for modification.

               ~ Open for Extension: The behavior of a class or module can be extended to accommodate new functionality.

               ~ Closed for Modification: Once a class or module is implemented and tested, it should not be modified.
               Instead, new behavior should be added through extension, such as by adding new subclasses or using polymorphism.

               This principle encourages developers to write code that can be extended without changing the existing code,
               which is crucial for building scalable and maintainable systems.

-> Why is it Important?
               * Prevents breaking existing code: By adhering to the Open/Closed Principle, you avoid modifying existing code
                 that is already working. Instead, you extend its functionality.

               * Improves maintainability: As your software grows, this principle ensures that new features
                 can be added easily without touching or breaking the existing functionality.

               * Promotes reusability: By writing code that is open to extension, developers can reuse existing components and
                 extend them as needed for new requirements.
